# E.C.O.: Energy Consumption Optimizer

ECO is a web-based platform designed to monitor and optimize household utility consumption (covering electricity, gas, and water)
through integration with smart furniture hookups. The platform also offers personalized consumption filtering based on the user of the house.

## Real-Time Monitoring & Optimization
By continuously collecting data from smart furniture hookups, the platform will provide real-time monitoring of utility usage.
Users will view the on/off status of smart furniture hookups via an interactive map, ensuring immediate visibility into utility consumption.
In addition, the platform will provide a dashboard with historical consumption data and other relevant information.
For the optimization, the platform will forecast future consumption and will provide an alert system when consumption approaches or exceeds pre-set thresholds.

## Filter by user
The platform provides a macro view of overall household consumption while also allowing to filter any consumption to display individual user data,
offering both comprehensive and detailed insights into utility usage.
